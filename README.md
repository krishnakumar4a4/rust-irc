# rust-irc
A chat server and client built with rust emulating a irc channel behavior

A complete [how to guide](Building_a_simple_IRC_with_rust.pdf) for the repository is available to get started.

Both client and server are dockerized to make the deployment easy on any virtual machine or even on your local machine.
